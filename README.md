## Description
A simple JavaScript program that calculates a student's grade based on marks between **0 and 100**.  
The grading scale is as follows:
- **A**: Marks > 79
- **B**: Marks 60 - 79
- **C**: Marks 50 - 59
- **D**: Marks 40 - 49
- **E**: Marks < 40  

If the marks entered are outside the range **0â€“100**, the program displays an error message.
