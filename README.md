## Description
This project contains three beginner-friendly JavaScript programs:
1. **Student Grade Generator** – Determines a student’s grade based on their marks.
2. **Net Salary Calculator** – Calculates net salary after PAYE tax, NHIF, and NSSF deductions.
3. **Speed Detector** – Checks vehicle speed and assigns demerit points or a license suspension.

Each program runs in the terminal console and demonstrates basic JavaScript control flow, functions, and input validation.
